# Coffee-Sales-Dashboard
Data was brought from different Excel sheets into one using XLOOKUP, VLOOKUP, INDEX, and MATCH functions.
Pivot tables, pivot charts, slicers, and timelines were used to create the interactive dashboard.
A timeline slicer is used to filter data by months and years, while product size and roast type slicers are used to filter data by packet size and coffee roast type.
In the dashboard, a line chart shows the sales of different coffee types over the months, one horizontal bar chart displays the top 5 customers, and another horizontal bar chart shows sales by country.
